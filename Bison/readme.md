# Parsing Bison grammars with Antlr

This code is a translation of the Bison grammar into Antlr. The purpose of this is for conversion
of Bison grammars into Antlr using my transformation system Piggy. The grammar accepts 
1000+ Yacc-based grammars I've collected from Github, and includes
some non-Bison extensions. The program outputs the token stream and parse tree.
