* [A parser for Mysql](https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrExamples/tree/master/mysql) -- This excellent example of the power of Antlr 4 is from the Oracle Workbench library
at https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/tree/8.0/library/parsers/grammars, and written by
Mike Lischke.

* [Why you should not use a LHS predicate in Antlr Lexers](https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrExamples/tree/master/perf).

* [Parsing Bison grammars with Antlr](https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrExamples/tree/master/Bison). This program parses Bison grammar files using Antlr!

* [Parsing Antlr grammars with Antlr](https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrExamples/tree/master/Antlr). This program parses Antlr4 grammar files using Antlr.

* [Parsing context-free languages in the Antlr lexer](https://github.com/kaby76/AntlrExamples/tree/master/lexer-as-parser). This program demos the use of the well-known expression grammar in the lexer. The rules can't have left recursion, and they all need to be marked with the _fragment_ keyword, but it works.
