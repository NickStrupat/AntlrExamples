# MySQL Workbench Parser

This code is my translation of the Antlr parser from
the Oracle Workbench library
at https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/tree/8.0/library/parsers/grammars (written by
Mike Lischke).

* The translation removes all but the code for the parser, except
for a few unused methods in MySQLSymbolInfo.cs, which seem somewhat useful.

* The code source tree was flatten into one directory.

* The Antlr are processed automatically using Antlr4BuildTasks.

* The error reporting using the "Code Completion" routines were completely replaced with my
own lookahead predictor because Mike's code does not work correctly. The
LASets.cs code contains a complete ATN parser. The tree walkers,
used in the error reporting code,
were removed in favor of the simplier error reporting method I wrote.
